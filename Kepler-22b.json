A telescope pointing back at me On Kepler-22b A telescope pointing back at me On Kepler-22b A telescope pointing back at me On Kepler-22b A telescope pointing back at me Good for ya Obsession is good for ya Good for ya Obsession is good for ya Good for ya Obsession is good for ya Good for ya Obsession is good for ya"}
